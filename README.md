# Cheese-shear-model
Modelling the shear modulus of cheese, using the Gillies model and a computational colloidal gel model. 
This was a project for my BSci Physics Project.

Update code 5 is the best working version, as it uses the velocity verlet integration scheme (which is widely used for particle simulation), but the original may be better under some circumstances. Final plots will plot the results from selected runs. Sensitivity analysis compares to the Gillies model.
